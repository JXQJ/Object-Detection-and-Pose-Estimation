# Object-Detection-and-Pose-Estimation
Pose estimation project involves the finding the X,Y &amp; Z of the object relative to the camera. The algorithm used is SURF(Speeded-Up Robust Feature). The algorithm detects the feature of base image and the features of the video and feature matching is done. Based on the matched features the object is detected. The pose is estimated by deviation from centroid of the detected object and the current position of object.  Tools: MATLAB, Computer Vision Tolbox
